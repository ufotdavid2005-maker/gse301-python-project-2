Description:
This project is a Python program that reads numerical and categorical data from files, performs basic statistical analysis, and saves the results to a report file. It demonstrates core Python concepts such as file handling, error handling, functions, loops, conditional statements, sets, and object-oriented programming.

Features:
Reads numeric data from a CSV or text file
Calculates total, average, minimum, and maximum values
Evaluates performance based on an average threshold
Extracts unique categories using sets
Handles missing files and invalid data
Saves analysis results to a report file

Files Used:
dataset_management_system.py – Main Python program
numbers.csv – File containing numerical data
categories.txt – File containing categorical data
report.txt – Generated report file

How to Run:
Make sure Python is installed on your system.
Place numbers.csv and categories.txt in the same folder as the Python file.
Run the program
View the results in the terminal and in the generated report.txt file.
